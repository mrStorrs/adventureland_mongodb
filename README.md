# Adventure Land - The Code MMORPG (MongoDB Edition)

https://adventure.land

A full Node.js + MongoDB port of [Adventure Land](https://github.com/kaansoral/adventureland), originally built on Python 2 / Google App Engine / Datastore. This version replaces all of that with Express, Socket.IO, and MongoDB.

## Repositories

This project is split across three repositories:

| Repository | Description |
|---|---|
| [adventureland_mongodb](https://github.com/kaansoral/adventureland_mongodb) | Main game — Express backend, game server, client assets |
| [common_engine](https://github.com/kaansoral/common_engine) | Shared engine — Express init, MongoDB transactions, request handling, admin tools |
| [adventureland_secretsandconfig](https://github.com/kaansoral/adventureland_secretsandconfig) | Config template — keys, options, server definitions (all values randomized/empty) |

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone all three repositories

```sh
# Main game
git clone https://github.com/kaansoral/adventureland_mongodb.git adventureland

# Shared engine (symlinked as adventureland/common)
git clone https://github.com/kaansoral/common_engine.git common

# Config template (symlinked as adventureland/secretsandconfig)
git clone https://github.com/kaansoral/adventureland_secretsandconfig.git secretsandconfig
```

### 2. Create symlinks

```sh
cd adventureland
ln -s ../common common
ln -s ../secretsandconfig secretsandconfig
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```sh
# Main backend
npm install

# Game server
cd node
npm install
cd ..
```

### 4. Set up MongoDB

Install MongoDB locally or use a hosted instance. The default config in `secretsandconfig/keys.js` points to `127.0.0.1:27017` with no auth — this works out of the box with a default local MongoDB install.

If your MongoDB requires authentication or TLS, edit `secretsandconfig/keys.js`:

```js
mongodb_ip: "your-server-ip",
mongodb_port: "27017",
mongodb_user: "your-user",
mongodb_password: "your-password",
mongodb_name: "adventureland",
mongodb_tls: true,                                          // set to true if using TLS
mongodb_ca_file: path.resolve(__dirname, "your-ca.crt"),    // place your CA cert in secretsandconfig/
```

### 5. Configure keys

Open `secretsandconfig/keys.js`. The keys auto-generate random values on each startup, which is fine for local development. For production, set fixed values:

- **`ACCESS_MASTER`** — Admin access key (used for server eval/render, admin tools)
- **`SERVER_MASTER`** — Server-to-server authentication
- **`BOT_MASTER`** — Bot authentication key
- **Stripe keys** — Only needed if you want payments
- **Steam/Discord/Apple keys** — Only needed for those platform integrations
- **Amazon SES** — Only needed for sending emails (verification, password reset)

### 6. Add a hosts entry (optional)

```sh
# Add to /etc/hosts (or C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts on Windows)
127.0.0.1       adventure.test
```

Then update `secretsandconfig/options.js`:
```js
base_url: "http://adventure.test",
```

Or just use `http://localhost` — the default config works without any hosts entry.

### 7. Start the backend

```sh
node main.js
```

The backend starts on port **8090** (configurable in `secretsandconfig/options.js`). Visit http://localhost:8090

At startup, the world preflight validates the required map documents, recovery
seed hash, and world indexes. Unrecognized legacy application collections are
reported in the classification diagnostics but do not, by themselves, prevent
the backend from starting.

### 8. Start the game server

```sh
cd node
node server.js local
```

The argument is a key from `servers` in `secretsandconfig/options.js`. The default `local` server runs on port **7192**.

## Character stat model

The character calculator keeps the existing player fields and weapon profiles,
but separates stat ownership by output type:

| Stat | Derived role |
|---|---|
| **STR** | Physical damage for melee and ranged physical weapons. It no longer adds derived HP, armor, or movement speed. |
| **DEX** | Crit chance and physical attack cadence. It does not add physical damage, movement speed, or accuracy. |
| **INT** | Magical damage and healing, `+15` max MP per point, and a capped magical cadence bonus. It no longer adds resistance or universal attack speed. |
| **VIT** | `+48` max HP per point. |
| **FOR** | Existing Fortitude damage reduction, supplied by equipment and effects. |

Physical profiles use the existing DEX frequency curve. Magical profiles apply an
INT cadence bonus capped at 20%; ability cooldown definitions are unchanged.
Total crit combines a diminishing DEX contribution (capped at 80%), raw gear
crit (capped at 20%), and temporary effects, with a hard 100% cap. Critical
damage and healing use the existing multiplier and `data.crit` display marker.
The direct `miss`, `evasion`, and `avoidance` checks remain unchanged; there is
no accuracy stat. Derived values are recomputed during the normal login and
equipment-refresh paths, so existing item instances do not require a database
reset or manual respec.

## Weapon progression

Legal visible combat weapons for Warrior, Paladin, Mage, Priest, Ranger, and
Rogue now use their easiest intended acquisition route to assign a semantic
rank. Monster routes above the permanent-monster median carry an additional
progression-access cost, so a difficult source is not treated as easy merely
because its drop chance is better. Within each skill, harder ranks receive no
lower requirement and no lower unenhanced Guide Base DPS; the existing
per-skill requirement and DPS slots are redistributed rather than expanded.
Weapon ownership, cadence, attributes,
enhancement inputs, and +1 through +4 behavior remain unchanged, and the five
ignored combat weapons stay unchanged. Deliberate TTK and broader weapon
balancing are separate work.

In the in-game Guide → Items view, visible weapons are grouped under Warrior,
Paladin, Mage, Priest, Ranger, and Rogue in combat-profile order. Each group is
sorted by the existing level-0 Base DPS calculation, with item ID as the
deterministic tie-breaker; ignored items remain hidden and the other item
categories keep their existing layout and detail actions.

The parity runner and checked-in fixtures expose current assigned requirements
alongside immutable historical DPS/TTK comparisons. Historical family and
handoff checks are retained as diagnostics, not release gates. Existing item
instances remain equipped through the normal equipment-refresh path; a future
equip or re-equip enforces the assigned requirement, with no migration or
respec step. To inspect the deterministic diagnostic chart locally:

```sh
node tools/weapon-progression-parity.js --format=markdown
```

## Seeding Game Data

The database needs map data and game entities to function. You have two options:

### Option A: Import from the RDBMS dump (recommended)

The original AppEngine development database is available at:
https://github.com/kaansoral/adventureland-appserver/blob/main/storage/db.rdbms

This SQLite file contains users, characters, maps, and all game data from the development server.

Use the migration scripts in `agentic/` to import this data into MongoDB:

```sh
# Set up Python environment
cd agentic
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install pymongo

# Run the RDBMS migration (reads db.rdbms, writes to MongoDB)
python _migrate_rdbms.py
```

See `agentic/` for additional fix scripts that handle ID prefixing, repeated fields, and other migration edge cases. The scripts are documented in `CLAUDE.md`.

### Option B: Start fresh

The game will create entities as needed. You can sign up for a new account through the web UI. You'll need to populate map data for the game server to function — the BFS precomputation (`node/precompute_bfs.js`) depends on map geometry being in the database.

For the protocol-3 local release, run the deterministic progression contract
scan from the umbrella repository. It checks the semantic progression
vocabulary without changing the local database. The read-only publication,
world, and map-seed tools are separate checks for plans that explicitly call
for them. Existing class-based consumers are not supported after the
skill/ability contract cutover.

## Making Yourself Admin

With `Local: true` and `unsecure_admin: true` in options.js, visit:

```
http://localhost:8090/admin/make/user/admin
```

While logged in. This sets `user.admin = true` on your account, giving access to `/admin/executor` and `/admin/renderer`.

With `Local: true` and `unsecure_admin: true`, all users are treated as admin automatically. This only works from localhost connections.

## Contributing

PRs are welcome! Please keep them **small and focused** — one fix or one feature per PR. Large PRs that touch many unrelated things are hard to review and likely to be rejected. If you're planning something big, open an issue or discuss it on Discord first.
